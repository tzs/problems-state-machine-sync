A few years ago, a friend asked if I had any interesting problems he and a
coworker of his might enjoy.

This is one of the problems I gave them--the synchronized state machine
problem. My description of the problem can be found in the file "state.pdf".
This problem is also known as the firing squad problem, and is described
here on Wikipedia:

This is not an easy problem, especially for people (like my friend) who have
not studied computer science. If you have not studied computer science, you
can be pleased with yourself if you are able to outline a solution of the
problem. If you actually produce a complete specification for the state
machines, you can be extremely pleased with yourself.

If you do go beyond outlining a solution and actually specify completely the
state machine, I've provided a simulator, in the directory "sim" that will
simulate the line of state machines so you can try out your solution and
see it work.

See the "README.txt" in the "sim" directory for instructions on building and
using the simulator.
